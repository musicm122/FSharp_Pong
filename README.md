Its not a 1:1 conversion and not 100% fp. I just wanted to see if I could do it. 


Built with  dotnet Standard 2 for the F# lib

Unity 2020.3.9f11 Personal Edition

Rider 2021.1.2 \ Visual Studio Code

and a lot of patients for getting unity to play nice with F# 

Instructions for setup of F# on unity (which is a bit of a finicky pain in the ass btw)
